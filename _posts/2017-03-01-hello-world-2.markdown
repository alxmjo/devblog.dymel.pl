I have [started this blog](/2016/02/27/hello-world/) exactly one year ago. I did it because I took part in a Polish contest called "Daj Się Poznać". The challenge was to have a pet project on GitHub and blog about it for 10 weeks. It was hard, but I survived and somehow ended up in 6th place :) Today, new edition of the same contest starts and I decided to accept the challenge again! 

# Daj Się Poznać 2016
In the last edition, my project was called MiSeCo. You can read more about it in the [MiSeCo](/tags/#miseco) category. It was meant to be a framework allowing easy communication between .NET Core microservices. Unfortunately, I didn't finish it. Maybe one day I will get back to it. 

# New beginning 
When [Maciej Aniserowicz](http://devstyle.pl) announced 2017 edition, I knew, I want to be part of it. You can read a [summary post](/2016/06/24/dajsiepoznac-summary-part-2-gala-final-thoughts/) from last year, but in short, it was a great experience and I have met many interesting people thanks to this contest. I don't know if time will allow me to write two posts a week, which is the requirement, but I will definitely try. 

# Stactive
I thought a lot, what project should I work on this time. At first, I wanted to continue MiSeCo, but in the end decided to do something else. Meet **Stactive** (I love these random names generators!). Stactive will be a library, which you can add to your **ASP.NET Core** project and it will allow you to easily create an event log of actions on your website. These actions will be saved in **ElasticSearch** and presented in **Kibana**. If you like the idea, go to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mdymel/stactive) and leave a star or watch it! :) 

# Summary
Last year, nearly 300 people registered for "Daj Się Poznać". When I am writing this post, 30 minutes before the registration is closed, there are over 750 contestants! This means, there will be many new blogs to watch for! I would like to wish everyone taking part in this good luck and to be persistent. It's not easy, but it's worth it!
