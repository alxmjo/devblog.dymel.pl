In the world we, software developers, live now, it's very hard not to have a job. If you have a Linked in account, you're probably getting job offers every few days. Maybe, You're replying "thank you, I am not interested" to most of them (or you don't reply at all, which is not so nice). But maybe you should be interested. How long have you worked in your current company? 2, 3, 5, 10 years? Is it time for a change? I will try to help you in asnwering this question today.

We live in an IT eldorado. There is more jobs than developers. Companies are in a constant race for perks. They offer higher and higher fees, better offices, bonuses, unlimited vacations. Everything - just to get your attention. There are two things I would like to discuss here. One is when it is not worth to change your job and the other - when it is. 

# Don't sell yourself for perks 
I know it's cool to have a pool table in your office. Or an Xbox, Foosball table, breakfast buffet, free lunches etc. It all does sound great, but if you're happy with your job, if you learn something new everyday, if the atmosphere in the office is great - it's probably not worth to trade it for some new perks. The same goes with money. If the other company is offering you more money, consider it only if it's significantly more than what you have now. Think about it. You like your current job. You know the people, know what to expect, have your position. Is it worth to trade it for 5% more on your payslip. I don't think so. 

# I am working in one company for X years - is it time to quit? 
In my opinion it makes no difference how long you've been working in one place. If you're happy with your job, if you're learning, if the work is interesting - why should you change it? Last year, I quit my job - after nearly 10 years. You could say I was crazy to work in one place for so long. Some people say you shouldn't work in one company for more than 5 years. In my opinion, it's a stupid rule. If you're not happy with what you do. Or you do the same things over and over again. If you don't progress with your knowledge. If you don't evolve as a developer. Quit! On the contrary. If you learn new things everyday. If you work with people who stimulate you, if you simply enjoy what you do - why should you quit - even after 10 years? Before I quit that job, I was working on web development, project management, Android apps, iOS apps, data processing, dev ops tasks. All of this was in one company, but it were, in fact, different jobs I took over the years. 

What I want to say here is that it's not important how long you've worked at a single company. It's important if you are motivated. If your job stimulates your growth as a developer. If it does - why would you change that? 

# Don't stay in a toxic job
You could get the impression, I am against changing jobs. I am not - I think it's not worth if there's no reason for that. But if it turned out only things you do are boring tasks, if your boss is crazy, or there is no team spirit - life is to short to work in such places. Think about it - you spend over 30% of your weekdays at work. If you don't like it, you need to search for something better.
